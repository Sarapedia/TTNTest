## about this code
The counter is an prototype we experimented with as part of the project Edge city in cooperation with htw Berlin. Its not a product and if you are interested in using it in your project please have a look at the issues above. In the Issues section you can find an overview of next steps that are necessary to scale the counter project.
Please use it an have fun to improuve it! If you want to use it outside make sure to make it waterproof. I want to thank Felix Hartard and Julia Zimmermann for contribute their ideas!
